# Fazle Rabbi

Fazle Rabbbi is Flutter based mobile app for both iOS and android platforms. The app is specifically built for a local shopkeeper who wants to automate his receipt system. This app does a phenomenal job in doing that.

Flutter framwork is used for the frontend of the app and pure dart code is used for the backend.
